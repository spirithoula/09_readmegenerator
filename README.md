# 09_readmegenerator

A professional README should be included in all projects to provide a brief, comprehensive overview of the project. This README generator helps the user create a professional README quickly. 

The generator prompts the user for the project title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, contributing, tests and questions. 
When all this information as been entered it will also prompt the user to choose a license. The badge for the license will be added to the README. 
The generator will also ask for the user's GitHub username and email.
